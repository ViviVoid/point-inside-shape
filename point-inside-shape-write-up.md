# Point Inside Shape Write Up

## Computational Problem Statement
### Name: IsPointInsideShape

Description: Given a sequence of $n$ vertices representing a shape, determine if a given point $p$ is within the boundaries of the shape defined by the sequence.

Input: A point, $p_i = <x_i, y_i>$, representing a 2D point and a sequence $S = <p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}>$ where $n$ is the number of vertices represented by each point in the sequence $S$ and for all points, $p_k \in S$ for some $0 < k < n$, $p_k = <x_k, y_k>$ where $x_k$ and $y_k$ are the x and y values for a given point.

Output: A boolean, if the given point $p$ is inside the shape defined by the seqence $S$.

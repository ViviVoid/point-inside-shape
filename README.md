# Problem: Point Inside Shape

- [x] A statement of the computational problem you are solving
- [ ] A one-paragraph description of a “decision rule” that can be applied to solve the problem. Provide at least two
examples illustrating how the rule is applied.
- [x] High-level pseudocode for an algorithm that uses your rule to solve the computational problem for all inputs.
- [?] A 1-3 paragraph justification of why your algorithm is correct.
- [x] An asymptotic analysis of the worst-case run-time of your algorithm
- [ ] A table of your test cases. For each, describe the input, the answer you would expect to get, and the answer you
actually got.
- [x] A table and graph from benchmarking your implementation on problem instances of different sizes.
- [x] A paragraph comparing your benchmarking results to your theoretical asymptotic run-time. This should include an
explanation of whether your results support your theoretically-derived run-time.
